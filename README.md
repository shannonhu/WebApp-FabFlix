# WebApp-FabFlix:

This is repository is a collection of a project class in database and web application: which includes
  1. A Java program that uses JDBC to interact with MySQL. It provides for the following functionality using a text-based console.
    -  Print out (to the screen) the movies featuring a given star. 
    - Insert a new star into the database. 
    - Insert a customer into the database.

  3. A XML Parser
      - Importing large XML data files into the Fabflix database.
      - Performance Tuning: Using two optimization techniques A naive implementation of your program is expected to be slow. Come up with at least two optimization techniques to reduce the running time of program.
