<title>xml parsing optimization</title>

<body>
To boost up our parsing speed, we use two optimization techniques to reduce the running time of our program:
<ol>
	<li>Batch Insert: Instead of passing the data one by one, we collect them all together and send it to one statement. When a batch is compiled, it's one transaction and all the pre-processing only happens once. By using this technique(autocommit is always off), we successfully reduced our parsing time from 7.0s to 1.0s with batch 128.</li>
	<li>Disable AutoCommit: When we run queries with autocommit = 1 (which is the default mode at MySQL). Every insert query begins a new transaction, which do some overhead. So we set the autocommit=0 to disable it execute in the separate transaction in every query. By using this technique(batch insert is always on), the running time is reduced from 6.6s to 0.9s.</li>
</ol>
