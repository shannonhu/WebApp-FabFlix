<head> Where and How we use the LIKE predicate in our website: </head>
<body>
    <p><b>We Use It At:</b>
<ul>- Advanced Search:<br>
    User will be able to get the result by only providing some substring of their information. The system supports "partial matching" for the term user enter in.</ul>

    <ul>- The attributes have been checked:
        <li>movie title;</li>
        <li>movie year;</li>
        <li>genre names</li>
        <li>star name (first, and last)</li>
    </ul>

<ul>The files are involved:
    <li>SearchQuery.java </li>
    <li>Query.java:</li>
</ul>


    <p><b>Why we use it:</b>
<ul>For Substring matching:
          by using the SQL operation LIKE with "%", we won't miss any possible results that includes the string in any pattern.
          For example:
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>'ABC%': All strings that start with 'ABC'. For example, 'ABCD' and 'ABCABC' would both satisfy the condition.
            </li>
        <li> %XYZ': All strings that end with 'XYZ'. For example, 'WXYZ' and 'ZZXYZ' would both satisfy the condition.
            </li>
        <li> %AN%': All strings that contain the pattern 'AN' anywhere. For example, 'LOS ANGELES' and 'SAN FRANCISCO' would both satisfy the condition.
            </li> 
        </ul>
